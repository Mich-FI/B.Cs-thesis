# Here are some topic ideas for my bachelor's thesis that I thought about

1. The Role of Cybersecurity in Securing PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
2. Data Breaches: Analysis, Consequences and Actions to Prevent Them
3. The Future of Controlling Data and Possessing Power <!--side note; enterprises buying more companies to ultimately become mega-corporations and have information that they can use for good or bad-->

# Here are some topic ideas for my bachelor's thesis that I thought about
P.s. I know comments in markdown also have an exclamation mark, I did this on purpose

1. The Role of Cybersecurity in Securing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) <--ID-verification in some states, UK and Australia, maybe coming to European Union; who's responsible for securing people's information on social media?-->
2. Data Breaches: Analysis, Consequences and Actions to Prevent Them
3. The Future of Controlling Data and Possessing Power <--side note; enterprises buying more companies to ultimately become mega-corporations and have information that they can use for good or bad-->
